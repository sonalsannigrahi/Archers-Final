# Record of Weekly Logs
This is a place to centralise each person's weekly log, so that it can then be sent at the end of each week.

The weeks will be recorded from saturday to friday, since the weekly logs are submitted on friday evening.

## Week 1 (16th Nov - 22nd Nov)

Andre Renom & Nicolas Lopes - This week we began planning the physics engine, and researched different ways of implementing it.
we settled that we needed to create a class of foces that would make our engine more adaptable and easier to complexify.
Our initial goal, which we will begin implementing next week, is to add gravitational and air resistance forces.

Alexandre Hirsch - This week, I began researching the menu class of our SFML game. In the following weeks, I will work on implementing it and other aspects of the HUD.

Sunho Hwang - This week we began planning on the general game design and what it would require. Our first goal would be to figure out the game map, the animations required, etc.

Minh Tuan Nguyen - Divided the team into smaller subteams for specific tasks, created a basic game class. Next week, we will set up basic classes (ie. background, water, ground).
