# Record of Weekly Logs
This is a place to centralise each person's weekly log, so that it can then be sent at the end of each week.

The weeks will be recorded from saturday to friday, since the weekly logs are submitted on friday evening.

## Week 1 (16th Nov - 22nd Nov)

Andre Renom & Nicolas Lopes - This week we began planning the physics engine, and researched different ways of implementing it.
we settled that we needed to create a class of foces that would make our engine more adaptable and easier to complexify.
Our initial goal, which we will begin implementing next week, is to add gravitational and air resistance forces.

Alexandre Hirsch - This week, I began researching the menu class of our SFML game. In the following weeks, I will work on implementing it and other aspects of the HUD.

Sunho Hwang - This week we began planning on the general game design and what it would require. Our first goal would be to figure out the game map, the animations required, etc.

Minh Tuan Nguyen - Divided the team into smaller subteams for specific tasks, created a basic game class. Next week, we will set up basic classes (ie. background, water, ground).

Hoang Anh Ngo - This week, I began to research on how to create splash screen/main menu screen and Game over screen. Start implementing the first lines of code for the Splash screen state. Next week, creating functions/buttons for the screens and start to think of the graphics.

Tarcisio Teixeira - This week, after setting everything up, I began planning the encryption of data and the structures to save them. Next week I plan to create an encryption class.

Sonal Sannigrahi - I have implemented a version of controlling the angle of the bow movement using the cursor. Still under testing and debugging. Next week, I will look into more functionalities of the characters involved.

Maelys Solal - This week I focused on setting up the VM and getting familiar with SFML. I began thinking about the Character, Opponent and Weapon classes. Next week, I will start implementing them and I will also continue learning about SFML. 

Alice Aubert - This week I helped set up the Trello and get everyone on the github repository. With the character player team we outlined the basic elements we wanted to include in the player and arrow class. I then has a existential break down trying and failing to install both the virtual machine and Xcode. Next week I will try to get one of them to work. 

Zhang Xingjian & Saba Tavdgiridze - We analyzed how to detect intersection for objects and resolve them. Next week, we will write the part of the code which is responsible for that part of the game.

Jiwon Park - This week I looked over SFML libraries how to draw 2D figures on window to start working on implementing basic classes such as game map.

## Week 2 (23rd Nov - 29th Nov)

Andre Renom - Met with Saba, Nicolas and Chris to discuss Physics engine, implementation was started with a vector and pointmass framework of forces. Vector operations were created to help with later development. Air resisitance as implemented as a force on a pointmass, and started BlackHoles were added as a subclass of Pointmasses.

Xingjian Zhang & Saba Tavdgiridze - Met with Physics Engine group members for discussion last Sunday. Began implementation of vector and pointmass frameworks and worked on solving collision. Next week, we will continue to work on the engine and try to test it using sfml.

Sonal Sannigrahi- Looking into sprite animation vs vector graphics through drawables. Implemented a click and drag function for the bow/arrow. Will be implementing character movements next.

Alice Aubert- This week I started working on how to animate the characters in the game, more specifically the attributes of the arrow class so that they can be implemented as drawables and sucessfully manipulated by the physics engine. Next week, I will work on finalizing this and making sure it works well in tandem with the character class
