# Record of Weekly Logs
This is a place to centralise each person's weekly log, so that it can then be sent at the end of each week.

The weeks will be recorded from saturday to friday, since the weekly logs are submitted on friday evening.

## Week 1 (16th Nov - 22nd Nov)

Andre Renom & Nicolas Lopes - This week we began planning the physics engine, and researched different ways of implementing it.
we settled that we needed to create a class of foces that would make our engine more adaptable and easier to complexify.
Our initial goal, which we will begin implementing next week, is to add gravitational and air resistance forces.
